# Interview-prep


This notebook is meant to serve as a useful guide for preparing for coding interviews. <br>
The main motivation for creating these are: 
 * Having major programming problem patterns in one place.
 * ML first principles with code and conceptual questions to brush up.
 * **Get ready for a tech interview in a week.**

## What this is not?

* A cheat sheet
* An exhaustive in-depth guide.

## Installation

There are poetry files provided. Easiest way to install is:
```poetry install```

## Start the notebook server

* Start the notebook server in the same directory as this Readme (the images don't appear otherwise because relative path issue)
* ```poetry run jupyter lab```

## Notebooks added
